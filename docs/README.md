## Overview

NetSentinel is a modular Python project that captures, parses, and analyzes network traffic to detect suspicious activity using custom security logic. This tool is designed to simulate real-world SOC responsibilities and demonstrate technical proficiency in packet-level traffic analysis and network threat detection.

## Key Features

- **Real-time packet capture** from network interfaces
- **Offline analysis** of PCAP files
- **Multi-layer analysis** (OSI Layers 2-4)
- **Threat detection** with customizable rules
- **Alert generation** with detailed context
- **Modular architecture** for easy extension
- **Comprehensive logging** and reporting

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Follow the [Installation Guide](installation.md)
2. **Configuration**: Set up your [Configuration](configuration.md)
3. **Quick Start**: Try the [Quick Start](quick_start.md) examples
4. **Advanced Usage**: Explore the [Examples](examples.md)

## Architecture Overview

NetSentinel is built with a modular architecture:

- **Core Models**: Data structures for packets, alerts, and connections
- **Services**: Packet capture and threat detection engines
- **Configuration**: Flexible configuration management
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and common operations
